# NodeJS Webscraper
Demo for showing how to scrape data and get backend data to the frontend. This repository is inspired by the video tutorial from Ania Kubow [here](https://youtu.be/-3lqUHeZs_0)

## To run this project

You can run this project on your local machine. Just pull it down and do the following:

### `npm i`

1. Run the command above to install all the packages

### Start the Project

### This project uses two npm scripts for different purposes:

2. Start the Node.js Application (server): This script uses nodemon to automatically restart the application whenever changes are detected in the source code (src/index.js).

```bash
npm start
```

3. Run Tailwind CSS in Development Mode: This script uses Tailwind CSS to process styles from ./src/input.css and outputs them to ./dist/output.css. The --watch flag enables Tailwind to watch for changes in the input file and update the output file accordingly.

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:8000/results](http://localhost:8000/results) with your browser to see the results of the scrape in your terminal.

5. Finally, open the index.html file in your browser to see the results showing up.
